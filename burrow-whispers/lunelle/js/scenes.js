/* One More Little Step — scenes.js V1.14
   V1.14: Scene 1 reeds hotspot replaced by the far-right large lotus (lotus-right) and a moon hotspot added (7 hotspots, 5 needed).
   Scene 2 and Scene 3 get the "Tap what catches your eye" hint. Scene 5 petal moved to the pine cluster (x 41, y 59) and petalHintY: 28 added so the hint text sits below the moon.

   V1.13: petal hints on all scenes (Scenes 1-3 point with an arrow, 4-5 only challenge); Scene 2 petal on the middle of the big tree; Scene 3 petal on the rock.
   V1.12: petalHint text on Scenes 1 and 2 (blinking arrow to the hidden petal once courage is full).
   V1.11: Scene 1 second left-lotus hotspot moved to the larger lotus nearer the middle.
   V1.10: Scene 5 (Farther From the Burrow) hotspots and petal placed. Petals moved: Scene 2 to the top of the left rock, Scene 3 onto the left mushroom. Scene 1 gets a sixth hotspot on the second left lotus (courage still needs 5).
   V1.9: Scene 3 petal moved beside the left tree (it vanished near the bright glow); Scene 4 (The Moth) hotspots and petal placed.
   V1.8: Scene 2 petal moved to the left rock; Scene 3 (The Clearing) hotspots and petal placed.
   V1.7: Scene 2 (The Silver Light) hotspots and petal placed on the real art.
   V1.6: Scene 1 extra hotspot moved to the far-left lotus so the five spots spread across the pond.
   V1.5: Scene 1 moon hotspot moved to the rocky hill (the moon was too
   bright for the tutorial glow to show).
   Scene data only. No behavior lives here.
   V1.1: Scene 1 tutorial hint text (interface guidance, not story dialogue).
   V1.2: Scene 1 hotspots and petal placed on the real pond art.
   V1.3: Lunelle sprites moved to images/sprites/.
   Hotspot and petal positions are percentages of the stage
   (x, y = left, top; w, h = width, height).
   Scenes 2 to 5 positions are still placeholders until their art is placed.
   Whisper text is deliberately empty: dialogue is written after
   the visual assets exist (project decision).
   V1.4: Lunelle's sprites moved to images/sprites/, the Scene 1 sprite is
   now half size near the shore and fades out after 5 seconds (with the crest
   shimmer scaling to the sprite and skipping once she's gone), and unfound
   hotspots glow again after 15 seconds without a discovery. */
